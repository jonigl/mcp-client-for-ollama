# Security

Security is a top priority; we appreciate responsible reporting.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do **not** open a public issue. Instead:

1. Go to this repoâ€™s **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide:

   * **A description of the vulnerability**
   * **Steps to reproduce the issue**
   * **Your assessment of the potential impact**
   * **Any possible mitigations**

## Security recommendations

* Keep the client up to date
* Run with only the necessary permissions
* Be careful about the MCP servers you use

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
